title: Splice Tech Demo
---

Prior to Splice's development, a team will be working on assets for a tech demo of the engine. 
These assets will be implemented during the 3rd iteration, and will be used to showcase the 
engine to players and developers alike, hoping to draw a crowd. Both will debut simulateously.

### Description
A basic description of the tech demo is as follows:

You are the only person in the entire timeline that has fully realized time traveling abilities. 
Through your experimenting, you come to realize how dangerous messing with time can be, and as 
such you go through time to eliminate changes to the timeline that occur unnaturally and to remove
that person's ability to travel through time.
